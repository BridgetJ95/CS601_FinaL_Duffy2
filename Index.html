<p class="homePara">
    During the Summer1 semester at Boston University's Metropolitan College, I took CS601:
    Web Application Development. I came in with a very basic understanding of HTML and CSS
    and no background whatsoever in JavaScript. This website, which details a brief personal
    history and describes my interests and hobbies, demonstrates a grasp of all three languages.
