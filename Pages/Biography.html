    <h1>Biographical facts: Bridget Duffy</h1>
    
    <h2>The early years</h2>

    <p>I grew up in a suburban town named Cranford in New Jersey. 
        I lived in the same house there my whole childhood. 
        Now, I live in Somerville; I've come full circle!
        I was born while my dad was in grad school at Harvard; my mom
        had me at Beth Isreal Hospital, right across the street from Simmons
        University where I recently got my MFA, and took my home to their apartment
        in Somerville--the very same zip code I live in now. But since
        they moved to NJ when I was just eigth months old, I don't think
        I can say that I'm <em>from</em> Somerville.</p>

    <h2>The later years: education</h2>
    <p> I went to St. Michael School from kindergarten through eigth grade;
        Mother Seton Regional High School for high school;
        University of Pittsburgh for College; and Simmons University for graduate school.
        I really loved school once I got to college;
        I've always been fairly good at academics,
        and once I was in college, I could drill down and focus on learning about my passions.
        I double-majored in English Fiction Writing and Classical
        Civilization, completed a certificate in Children's Literature,
        and got a minor in Latin.
    </p>
    <p> I loved learning Latin. The whole enterprise of translating Latin to English 
        felt like a puzzle to me--figuring out the correct translation of each word, where
        it fit into the sentence, and how that affected the sentence structure as a whole
        was so much fun, and so satisfying to watch the pieces click into place.<br />Writing
        code scratches a similar itch in my brain.
    </p>
    <p>
        After undergrad, I went write into grad school, pursuing an MFA in Writing for Children.
        I'm really proud of the work I did there; it was fantastic to learn and grow as a writer
        surrounded by people as passionate about children's literature and media as I am.
    </p>

    <h2>Present Day</h2>

        </figure>

    <p>Now, I spend my days working at Cengage Group as a Product Assistant and my
        Wednesday nights pursing a graduate certificate in Web Application Development
        at BU Met. I'm interested in shifting my career path toward something involving
        coding.
    </p>

    <p>However, there's plenty more I like to do with my time! Explore the site to learn
        more about my interests and passions.
