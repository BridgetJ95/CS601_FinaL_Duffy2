<h1>Writing</h1>

<h2>Beginning</h2>

<p>
    My love of books and active imaignation led me to writing at an early age. I loved creative
    writing assignments at school, and I ran the creative writing club while in high school.
</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
    I decided to focus my education on Creative Writing. I majored in Fiction Writing in college
    and got a certiifcate in Children's Literature as well, as young-adult fantasy always held a special
    place in my heart.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than pursuing a job first, I decided to go right into grad school. I got my MFA in
    Writing for Children at Simmons University. It was a fantastic experience; many academic 
    circles turn their noses up at children's literature, and it was a joy to spend two years
    of my life focused on writing with a group of people who loved and respected children's media
    as much as I do. While I was there, I completed two full manuscripts.
</p>
<p>
    Now, I'm focusing on my day job; for the time being, I write fiction about my and my friends'
    D&D campaign in my spare time.
</p>
<h2>Award and Publication</h2>
<p>
    I had a short story published in vol. 6 of the literary magazine <i>Wizards in Space</i>.
    Titled "Full of Grace," it deals with the complicated feelings that come from being gay and
    raised Catholic.
</p>
<p>
    In 2020, I won the Susan P. Bloom Discovery Award for one of the manuscripts I wrote
    in grad school.
</p>
<p>
    My short story and more information about the award can be found on my <a href="https://www.bridgetjduffy.com/">personal website</a>.
