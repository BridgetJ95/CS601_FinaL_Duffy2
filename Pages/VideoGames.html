<h1>Video Games</h1>

<p>It bothers me when I hear authors talking about having to compete with video games for
    their audience's attention; it's just not true! The kids who will read their YA fantasy
    are the same ones who have logged 200+ hours playing Skyrim.
</p>
<p>
    My favorite games tend to be very narrative-focused. I like fantasy games with a really
    solid story.
</p>

<h2>Favorites</h2>

<h3>Mass Effect series</h3>

<p>In the Mass Effect series, you play as Commander Shepard defending the galaxy from a
    race of sentient robots that want to wipe out organic life. What I love most about
    the game are the characters; you can build relationships with the characters on
    your team throughout the game. It's a world and story I love to return to.
</p>

<h3>Dragon Age Inquisition</h3>
<p>
    The Dragon Age series is created by the same folks behind Mass Effect, BioWare;
    however, for this series, the third game is decidedly my favorite. The art, characters,
    and narrative are the most satisfying, and has the most varied options for your
    player character and for story outcome based on your choices.
</p>

<h3>Hades</h3>

<p>
    Since getting my Switch during the pandemic, I've poured hours and hours into Hades.
    The art is beautiful and I love the characters, but as a Classicist, I'm seriously
    impressed by the way the creators played with Greek mythology to create the game.
    It's obvious that they knew their source material!
</p>

<h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
<p>
    Stardew Valley is part of a genre called "cozy games." It's a farming simulation where
    the player inherits a decrepit farm from their grandfather; they build of the farm,
    develop relationships, and reinvigorate the small community they joined. The stakes of
    the game are incredibly low, and it's very relaxing.
</p>
<p>
    Stardew is particularly impressive because it was created entirely by one person. Eric
    Barone, under the alias ConcernedApe, created the art and OST and coded the game in C# 
    completely by himself.
