<h1>Classics</h1>
<h2>"What is Classics?"</h2>

<p>I actually got this question a lot as a Classics major! Many assume "Classics" means
    Classical works of literature, but the field of Classics is actually the study of
    Ancient Greece and Rome.
</p>

<h2>Why Classics?</h2>
<p> I was really interested in Greek Mythology as a child. I enjoyed the stories, and I 
    loved fantasy to begin with. Loving the mythology felt like an extension of that love.
</p>
<p>
    I've never had a desire to make a career out of classics; I got a major in Classical
    Civilization and a minor in Latin purely for fun. After I graduated, my parents took
    to Rome! It was great to be able to tour the city and see the sites from the history
    I'd spent four years studying.
