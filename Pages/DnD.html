<h1> Dungeons & Dragons</h1>

<h2>"What is that?"</h2>

<p>
    Dungeons & Dragons is a very popular TTRPG (table-top roleplaying game). It's a genre
    of game where the players each have a character they create. A Dungeon Master (or DM)
    sets up and describes scenarios for the players' characters to react to; that's it!
    There are rules and mechanics, but at it's core, it's about using roleplay and a little
    bit of chance based on dice rolls to tell stories with your friends. We typically call
    the story a "campaign," likely as a holdover from when the game was focused on warfare
    and strategy as opposed to story, narrative, and roleplay.

    I got interested in D&D in high school, but didn't get a chance to play until I was in
    undergrad, and wasn't in a regular campaign until grad school when my friend Theo invited
    me to join a campaign he was starting. It was completely homebrewed, which means he came
    up with the setting wholecloth. It took place in a kingdom called Thevania, which had just
    undergone a brutal civil war. We ultimately had to defend the new republic.
</p>

<p>
    My character for Theo's campaign was a half-orc named Myev Belluasdaughter. She was a
    fighter class character, armed with a sword and shield, and had a background as a gladiator.
    She was 6'11 but told everyone that she was seven-foot even. She had an inferiority
    complex from being the only half-orc in her orc clan; she loved her friends very 
    much and ended the campaign living with one of the other players characters as besties and roommates.

    The campaign I'm in right now is run by friend Meaghan. We all call it "The Dad Campaign";
    in it, we all play dads from Boston who were transported to fantasyland and seperated from
    their kids. The campaign is focused around us each trying to track down our kids and get
    home. Naturally, we get embroiled in the machinations of forces bigger than ourselves along
    the way.
</p>
<p>
    My character for The Dad Campaign is Ron K. Chammer (pronounced exactly like "hammer").
    He's a stereotypical Boston Sports Dad--he's big, masculine, works in construction, and
    loves the Patriots. But he's very in touch with his emotions and is devoted to his husband
    and three kids; he also adopted another child while in fantasyland, so he's up to 4 kids
    now.
