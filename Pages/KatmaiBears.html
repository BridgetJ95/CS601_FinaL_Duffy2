<h1>Katmai Bear Cams and Fat Bear Week</h1>

<h2>Katmai National Park</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/index.htm">Katmai National Park</a> is located deep in the Alaskan bush, accessible only by float
    plain. Every year, salmons swim upriver there to spawn; Brooks falls is famous for 
    salmon leaping up the waterfall. Brown bears gather in great numbers to feast on
    the salmon. Luckily for us, the rangers at Katmai partnered with the folks at <a href="https://explore.org/livecams">explore.org</a>
    to instante the Brooks Falls Bear Cam! It livestreams constantly from the falls so that
    everyone around the world can enjoy the bears. While watching the cam below is fun, I'm
    planning my own trek out to Katmai National Park next year to see the bears for myself.

<h2>Fat Bear Week</h2>
<p>
    Every fall, Katmai and explore.org run Fat Bear Week to celebrate the bears getting
    plump for winter. It's a week-long, March-Madness style bracket where viewers get to
    vote for the bear they think did the best job plumping up before hibernation! It won't
    start until the end of September/early October, but last year's bracket can be found <a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/fat-bear-week.htm">here.</a>
